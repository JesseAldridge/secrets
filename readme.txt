Create a directory called decrypted.
Put all your secret files in there.
Run `secrets`.
Enter a password.
If an "encrypted" directory exists, all files in it are decrypted and copied over to the "decrypted" directory.
Press return when you are done working with your decrypted files.
Encrypted versions of your decrypted files are then created in the "encrypted" directory.
The decrypted directory is then deleted.
